Florida State University — AI Researcher

Focus: Large Language Models (LLMs), fine-tuning, and scalable NLP.

Fine-tuned LLMs on datasets exceeding 50,000 examples using LoRA and PEFT, achieving 10–15% gains in task accuracy on models such as DistilGPT2.

Built scalable NLP pipelines using Hugging Face and PyTorch.

Applied mixed-precision training and batch tuning to reduce training time by 35%.

Contributed to ParticleViz, an open-source visualization tool that displays Lagrangian particle simulations on interactive web maps, helping Earth Science researchers explore spatial and temporal patterns.

Learnscape AI — Founder and Developer

Built LearnScape AI, an intelligent learning platform that generates personalized study roadmaps, quizzes, and flashcards using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM-based evaluation pipelines.

Implemented a modular backend using FastAPI, dbt, and PostgreSQL to support scalable knowledge retrieval and progress tracking.

Worked on knowledge evaluation, content generation, and user engagement optimization using fine-tuned LLMs and semantic search techniques.
